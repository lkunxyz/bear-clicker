## **What is Bear Clicker?**
*Bear Clicker* is an educational game created using Tynker’s coding platform, aimed at teaching programming basics through incremental gameplay. Designed by Labored Label, the project emphasizes hands-on learning, allowing players to interact with code blocks that control variables, loops, and conditional statements.  

The game revolves around tapping a bear to accumulate points, which can be spent on upgrades to automate point generation—a practical demonstration of variables and arithmetic operations. Players encounter delays, loops (simple and advanced), and logic-based challenges, mirroring real coding scenarios. Tynker’s kid-friendly interface simplifies complex concepts, making it ideal for classrooms or self-paced learning. As part of Tynker’s global coding curriculum, used by over 100 million students, *Bear Clicker* exemplifies how games can demystify programming while fostering creativity and problem-solving skills.  

## **How to Play**  
1. **Objective**  
   Tap the bear to earn points. Use points to purchase upgrades that automate tapping, teaching the relationship between variables and game mechanics.  

2. **Basic Mechanics**  
   - **Variables**: The game uses `points` as a primary variable. Each tap increases `points` by 1.  
   - **Upgrades**: Buy "Auto-Clickers" (costing 10 points) to increment `points` automatically every second. This introduces loops and delays in code.  

3. **Coding Concepts**  
   - **Simple Loops**: Auto-clickers run on a `forever` loop, adding points continuously.  
   - **Conditionals**: Unlock achievements (e.g., "First 100 Points") using `if` statements that check `points >= 100`.  
   - **Math Operations**: Calculate upgrade costs with formulas like `cost = base_cost * multiplier`, teaching arithmetic logic.  

4. **Advanced Features**  
   - **Multipliers**: Implement `point_multiplier` variables (e.g., 2x points) to demonstrate variable reassignment.  
   - **Nested Loops**: Introduce "Super Clickers" that require loops within loops for exponential point gains.  

5. **Debugging**  
   Encounter intentional "bugs" (e.g., a mispriced upgrade) and learn to troubleshoot by adjusting code parameters like delay times or cost calculations.  

6. **Remix the Project**  
   Tynker allows users to clone and modify *Bear Clicker*. Experiment with:  
   - Adding sound effects triggered by conditional statements.  
   - Creating new variables like `bear_energy` to limit tapping stamina.  
   - Designing custom sprites or backgrounds using Tynker’s art tools.
